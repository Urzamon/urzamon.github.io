I know your eyes in the morning Sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again
<br>
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
<br>
How deep is your love
How deep is your love, how deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
<br>
I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my saviour when I fall
<br>
And you may not think that I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
<br>
How deep is your love
How deep is your love, how deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
<br>
Da da da da da
Da da da da, da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da
<br>
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love and then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
<br>
How deep is your love
How deep is your love, how deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
<br>
Da da da da da
<br>
How deep is your love, how deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
<br>
Da da da da da
<br>
How deep is your love, how deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be

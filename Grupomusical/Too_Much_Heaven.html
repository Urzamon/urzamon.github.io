Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb
<br>
Ooh, you and me, girl
Got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you and it flows through me
And I love you so much more
<br>
Then my life
I can see beyond forever
Everything we are will never die
Love is such a beautiful thing
Oh, you make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away?
<br>
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb
<br>
You and me, girl
Got a highway to the sky
We can turn away from the night and day
And the tears we had to cry
<br>
You're my life
I can see a new tomorrow
Everything we are will never die
Love is such a beautiful thing
When you are to me the light above
Made for all to see our precious love
<br>
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb
<br>
Oh, oh
Love is such a beautiful thing
You make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade?
<br>
Oh, oh, oh
<br>
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as wide as a river and harder to climb
<br>
Oh, oh, oh
<br>
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb
<br>
Oh, oh, oh
<br>
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb

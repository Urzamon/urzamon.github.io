Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And now it's all right, it's okay
You may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man
<br>
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive
<br>
Oh, when you walk
<br>
Well, now I get low and I get high
And when I can't get either, I really try
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose
You know, it's all right, it's okay
I'll live to see another day
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man
<br>
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive (ooh)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive
(Aaah)
<br>
Life's goin' nowhere, somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life's goin' nowhere, somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive
<br>
Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born
And now it's all right, it's okay
You may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man
<br>
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive
(Ooh)
